# hivew: Hive ❤️ WASM

WASM toolchain for Hive

`hivew` is the central tool for Hive and WASM. `hivew` can build WASM Runnables, and will soon be able to package many WASM Runnables into deployable bundles. It will also be able to act as an all-in-one Hive server, using the upcoming FaaS functionality in Hive.

Docker must be installed to build WASM Runnables.

To build a Rust-based Runnable, see [rs-wasm](./rs-wasm/README.md)

`hivew` is under active development alongside [Hive](https://github.com/suborbital/hive) itself.
